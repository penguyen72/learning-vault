### Overview
Praetorian discovered a vulnerability in AWS Lambda functions. Regardless of whether a Lambda function is provisioned with an IAM execution role or is containerized in an isolated environment. It is possible for an unauthorized user to run malicious code on this lambda to read sensitive data such as Github tokens.
### Main Content
This exploitation can occur when a client has set up a Github workflow that builds the Github repository on a Lambda instance. This workflow can be triggered with a pull request that builds the user's branch that can contain malicious code. 

The attacker can run a script to observe all subsequent events run on this Lambda instance. This means that if another user triggers this Lambda then it is possible to read their Github token

### Key Points
Once the Lambda instance dies, this instance will then be purged. However, it is possible to create a script that will always be running which will keep the instance alive
