A [[Machine Learning]] technique that teaches software how to make decisions to achieve the best outcomes
#### Differences between Machine Learning
For machine learning you often have a dataset that you are using to train your model. In reinforcement learning, the agent is interacting with the environment to create it's own data to learn and train from.
#### Goal
It focuses making decisions to maximize cumulative rewards
#### Applications of Reinforcement Learning
- Self-driving cars
- Robotics
- Games
